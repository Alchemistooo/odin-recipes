# odin-recipes

In this project I will be creating a basic website, hosting a list of links to my favourite recipes. By the end of the project I will have demonstrated various skills including linking (<a href>) to webpages and images using relative and absolute paths, adding text to a webpage using Heading (<h1-6>) and Paragraph (<p>) tags, as well as tracking my progress using git (git add/commit/push).
