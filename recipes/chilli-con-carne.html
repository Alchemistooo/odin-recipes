    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The dish known simply as Chili in the US and Canada is known as Chilli Con Carne here in Australia and in the UK.</p>
      <p>It looks like Bolognese and is cooked like Bolognese, except there's a load of Tex-Mex spices added. It tastes like a saucy version of the good ole' beef mince taco filling we all know and love (that is nowhere to be found in Mexico!!). It's supposed to be spicy, but I won't judge if you can't handle the heat!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves , minced</li>
        <li>1 onion , diced (brown, white, yellow)</li>

        <li>500g beef mince</li>
        <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>800g can crushed tomato</li>
        <li>420g can red kidney beans , drained</li>
        <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp sugar (any type)</li>
        <li>125 - 375 ml water</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Spice Mix</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 - 2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>4 tsp paprika powder</li>
        <li>5 tsp cumin powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp oregano</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To Serve</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rice, corn chips, tortillas</li>
        <li>Sour cream, yoghurt, grated cheese, coriander.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 1 minute, then add the bell pepper and cook for 2 minutes until onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as you go, until mostly browned.</li>
        <li>Add Chili Spice Mix. Cook until beef is browned all over. (This step helps release extra flavour from the spices)</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients, with 1/2 cup of water for Quick Cook or 1 1/2 cups for Slow Cook. Bring to simmer, then adjust heat per step below:</li>
        <li>Quick Cook - 20 to 40 minutes, uncovered, on medium low heat so it's bubbling gently; OR</li>
        <li>Slow Cook - 1.5 hours to 2 hours, covered, on low heat so it's bubbling very gently.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste just before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice, or ladle into bowls and serve with corn chips or warm tortillas on the side with Toppings of choice. </li>
      </ol>
