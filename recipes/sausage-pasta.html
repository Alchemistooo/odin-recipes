    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Today, I'm sharing a flavour loaded, decadent creamy tomato sausage pasta sauce that I deem to be orecchiette worthy. The little bits of sausage nestled in those little cups, blanketed in that creamy sauce â€¦ mmmm! It's so good it should be illegal!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>400g orecchiette pasta</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves , minced</li>
        <li>500g Italian pork sausages , meat squeezed out of their casings</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato passata</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup parmesan , finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian herbs</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp each salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 cups (packed) baby spinach , torn into bite size pieces</li>
        <li>Parmesan , for serving</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to the boil and cook pasta according to packet directions MINUS 1 minute. Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a very large skillet over high heat. Add garlic and cook for 15 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add sausage meat and cook, breaking it up as you go, until there are some little golden bits - about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the skillet to remove the golden bits, and allow wine to evaporate - the winey smell will disappear.</li>
        <li>Add remaining ingredients except kale. Stir well, bring to simmer then turn stove down to low and simmer gently for 2 minutes to bring all the flavours together.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and kale. Toss well for 1 minute to coat pasta well with the sauce - it will thicken. If the sauce gets too thick, use the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen it up.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, garnished with freshly grated parmesan.</li>
      </ol>
